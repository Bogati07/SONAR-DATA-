# SONAR-DATA-MBES
MBES data processing for sediment volume calculaiton in dove elbe region.
This report provides an insight into the applications of the hydrographic survey and methodologies involved in the process. This research would help us understand the sediment accumulation patterns through sediment mass calculation per square meter (kg/m2) of the bed surface. Data was collected using various tools and programs, cleaned up, and processed using Qimera and QGIS. Python was used to compare various target areas and visualize data. The MBES, SBES data and SVP data acquired from DvOcean with Quincy are used for the research. MBES data is used for investigation of the sea floor and understand- ing the ripple patterns. Low and high frequency data are used to compare and estimate the depth of the sediments. Depth data are imported in python for visualization and calculation of mean height of the sediments layer. Five different locations are finalized for the investigation after analyzing the bathymetry of the entire survey area with MBES data.
